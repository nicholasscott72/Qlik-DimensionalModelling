# Qlik-DimensionalModelling
This project promotes the use of a simple development methodology for QlikView applications. By leveraging commonly understood development concepts a `development framework` can be created which will deliver a robust and scalable `data warehouse` suitable for business analysis.  

As a broad proposition the project adopts a 3-tier application architecture (**E**xtract, **T**ransform and **L**oad) and a dimensional data model [Kimball methodology (http://www.kimballgroup.com/data-warehouse-business-intelligence-resources/kimball-techniques/)] in QlikView.  

[Rob Wunderlich (https://github.com/RobWunderlich/Qlikview-Components)] sets out another more `programatical` approach which may suit `programmers` rather than `business analysts`. This can also be seen in the @Qlik `QlikView Development Framework`. 

The project is linked with the `QlikView Practitioners Guide` project. 

# QlikView Practitioners Guide
The `QlikView Practitioners Guide` is a project to document a common QlikView development methodology as well as the core elements of project and contract management.  The `QlikView Practitioners Guide` will include templates for many element of the technical, project and contract management requirements.

## 1. Technical Development
QlikView is a powerful and flexible business intelligence tool.  However, to maximise the benefits a structured approach requires to be followed.  A structured approach or `methodology`, facilitates collaboration by creating a common language for the development.  

## 2. Project Management
Project Management includes all elements from the initial identification of a project requirement, through the creation of a project team ana the management of their tasks, to the delivery of the project.  For most organizations, Project Management is a subset of Lifecycle Management.

## 3. Contract Management
The delivery of services by Third Party Suppliers requires the creation of a contract and the monitoring of the provision of the services against the agreed contract.  Contract Management includes all elements from the identification and selection of Third Party Suppliers to the final Sign Off of the completed project. 

## Templates
Templates provide a simple starting point for a task, ensure that the core issues are adequately addressed.
